# Project Description

Building a mini app to practice passing props from "parent" component to "child" component in React.

Key points to remember:

1. In this example, Body.jsx is the parent component and holds the images array. We are sending the images array to the ImageList component via props.

2. Also, continued with lecture video to create a list of images using the spread method (...). This is a bit tricky (for now at least).
